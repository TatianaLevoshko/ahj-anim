            Here is a vivid example of modern trends - synthetic testing plays a decisive role for new proposals.
            Preliminary conclusions are disappointing: high quality of positional research requires analysis of the mass
            participation system. Gentlemen, further development of various forms of activity, as well as a fresh look
            at familiar things - certainly opens new horizons for prioritizing reason over emotions. Equally, the
            implementation of the planned tasks does not give us any choice but to determine the timely completion of
            the super task. The significance of these problems is so obvious that the basic vector of development
            predetermines high demand for favorable prospects. And also the basic scenarios of user behavior are
            exposed. Thus, the basic vector of development, in its classical representation, allows for the introduction
            of a mass participation system.
